# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# require 'faker'
#
#
# user_ids = [1, 2, 3] # Replace with the actual user IDs
# num_posts_per_user = 15 # Adjust as needed
#
# num_posts_per_user.times do
#   user_id = user_ids.sample
#   title = Faker::Lorem.sentence
#   description = Faker::Lorem.paragraph
#
#   Post.create(user_id: user_id, title: title, description: description)
# end
